//REACT ROUTER

Npm i react-router-dom

it keeps the ui sync with different url.

its used to navigate from different componenent.


// Func 1 - createBrowserRouter ///
its nothing but a function.
It was given by react-router-dom  and using for creating a router.
it have list of path.

//Func 2 - RouterProvider//

it will render all the routes that we put inside createBrowserRouter.it will render all the componenent in order wise.


//Func 3 - useRouteError //

It was a hook,so it was a function, it gives an error with good ui,error happen if we use unused path.


SPA - Single page application 
Single page application means if we route to any other page,it will not fetch the data again.
already we have componenent it will use that.
it was an client side routing
we use Link Tag from react-router-dom library for this.

server-side routing
if we route to any other page,it will fetch the data again from network and laod the content.
ex : <a></a>



///Children for my Parent Route///

Children : [{},{}] inside my createBrowserRouter so body only change, header and footer will be fixed.

//Outlet //- component
Outlet will overwrite my component based on path.


//Dynamic routing //
Id will be changed based on the data.


 // const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");//

 what if(console.log(useState()))

 it gives the array with two elements
 1.state variable - undefined
 2.callback function


 Dynamic Routing : 

 In useParams() hook we able to read url and get my Dynamic id;


 Key must be in mapping element,that means parant element;(map - loop)

///Formik ///

useFormik() - It was an hook and its used to build and manage the react forms.

Its a function and returns the object.

useFormik({
    initialValues :{
        name : ''
    },
    onSubmit : (argument, automatically get the value),
    validate : (values) =>{
    let error = {}
    return error
    }
})

 onChange={formik.handleChange}    => onchange event triggred
 value = {formik.values.name} = > assigning the value indivually
<form onSubmit = {formik.handleSubmit}>
formik.touched.firstname = > if write outside it will return true
  {...formik.getFieldProps("confirmPassword")} - it have onBlur,onchange,value,name

 initial values => managing the state

 formik.values
 formik.errors

 yup is an javascript library and is used to validate the react forms.



 Formik components

 Formil => Useformik hooks
 Form => handleSubmit
 Field => handleChange,handleblur,value,getFieldProps
 errormessages => conditional rendering
