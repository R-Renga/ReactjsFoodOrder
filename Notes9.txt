Why do we need css frameworks?

Because it was optimized css,more readable and savings time.


css-> it was an statndard language.it gives some presentation to our website

scss-> sassy css is a preprocessor that give additional features to css like nesting,variables.
       In Browser it convert to css.


internal css - > writing css inside jsx.

when use library for css - > it have consistent ui,maintainable,readable,reusable.

matrial ui,
ant design,
base ui.
tailwind css
bootstrap.

It gives pre Build component.


DISADVANTAGE - > it makes the bundle size heavier.

sass -  >syntactically awesome style sheet.


native css - css have common file like index.js and we do raw css.
scss - sassy css is a preprocessor that give additional features to css like nesting,variables.
       In Browser it convert to css.\

library (pre build component) -  it have consistent ui,maintainable,readable,reusable.
                                 materialui, ant design, chakra, base ui

Inline = > it have css in jsx <h1 style={{
 color : red;
}}></h1>

styledComponents - > it was an library,it makes our html tag as styledComponents.write css in jsx.also add props to it.
                    props => ${props.primary ? "blue" : "red"} 
                    lambda


import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button `
color:red;
padding : 2px;
color : ${props => props.primary ? 'red':'blue'}
`

component {
       <Button>submit</Button>
       <Button primary></Button>
}


scss and sass - syntax will be differ.


//Tailwind css///

1.Write css on the go.it means write css in same file.
2.reusablity
3.less bundle size
4.flexible ui (customization)

Tailwind - default behaviour if we add in our project.if we didnt give css class name.you need to write 
           in tailwind style.otherwise it will be overwritted.

1.We put our css in className


npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init


postcss - > it used to convert our tailwind css to normal css in browser.
tailwind.config.js - > while exeuting tailwind using npx - inside we declare the file tailwind needs to apply.
.postcssrc -> configure tailwind, to tell our bundlers to that our project have tailwind, so bundle that also.
              bundle size was less for tailwind.

index.css - @tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

tailwind also have code splitting,its just like importing tailwind in our css file.

tailwind css intellisense -> it give suggestion when we using tailwind css. extension.
