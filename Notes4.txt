//src folder


src folder is help us to maintain the code readable.

every features and routes also have separate files.

//components
 
Every features in react works under components,so it will have the separate folder.it comes under src folder.

All the components and all files runs under one root. => that is App.js/index.js , so it will be in direct src folder



Import and export

There are two ways of import and export the files

default import and export


/**
export default functionname

default import only one thing

import functionname from './app';

we can give any name while import
**/


/**
export by names

using this we export mulitple Functions

import {functionnames1,functionname2} from './app.js';

import * as obj from './app';

obj.functionname1();

**/
Both:

import Header,{function names1,function name2}  from './app.js';
import Header,{function names1,function name2}  from './app';

jsx/js - both are same for file name


../ used to navigate to the parent  directory

./ used to navigate to the current directory

config file and Constant file  => Both are used to maintain the hard code datas, which means global data against variable.



//Input tag


when use value attribute in input tag, cant able to write text inside.

//onChange

it was an event attribute , it gives output as an object



///***************** important**************//

If you want to maintains the variable that changes means,then u want to maintain the react kind of variable.


react variable === state variable

Every component in react maintains the state ,you can put all the variable in that state.

every time when u  create local variable you  use state inside react.then only state maintains the variable.



Hooks is nothing but a function,its used to use state and other react features in functional component.

In react we cant able to change or update the local variable data,so react gives state for us to update the
modify the data.



Usestate : 

It was a react hook, its used to modify the local variable,it returns the array with two elements, first one was written
state variable,second one was a function that used to update that variable value.

const [firstelement, setFirstElement] = useState()


onChange = > onchange is used to triggered the event when value of elements changes

React doesn't know that where the local variable changing.  

DataBinding = it will establish your connection between your UI and Data.ui will change automaticaaly when the state changes.
React is the one way binding
